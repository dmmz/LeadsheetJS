# LeadsheetJS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SonyCSL-Paris/LeadsheetJS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SonyCSL-Paris/LeadsheetJS)
A JavaScript library for online music leadsheets (visualizing, playing, editing and other features). 
2015 Daniel Martín, Timotée Neullas and Vincent Degroote.
Examples and documentation http://sonycsl-paris.github.io

##Installation
Inside the LeadsheetJS folder, you need to run [npm](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm) to get all the dependencies:

    npm install --prod

## How to use 
LeadsheetJS uses RequireJS, so you should have 2 script tags: 	
```html
<script src="path_to/require.js"></script>
<script src="LeadsheetJS_folder/config.js"></script>
```	
and then you can use it this way 
```javascript
require.config({
	baseUrl: "path_to_your/LeadsheetJS_folder/",
});
require(
	['LJS', '/absolute_path_to_song/song.js'], 
	function(LeadsheetJS, song) {
		//we set the parameters
		var params = {
			// minimum parameters for viewer
			viewer: {HTMLElement: document.getElementById('myViewerDiv')}, 
			// minimum parameters for player
			player: {HTMLElement: document.getElementById('myPlayerDiv')}, 
			// minimum parameters for edition (notes chords and structure are editable by default)
			edition: {notes: true},
		};
		// We initialise LeadsheetJS
		var myLeadsheet = LeadsheetJS.init(song, params);
		// You are using LeadsheetJS
	}
);
```
The first part (require.config) defines the LeadsheetJS folder so require can resolve easily all the paths. If you wan't to use your own libraries, you need overload the paths values defined in config.js. For instance if you want to use your own version of jquery, you have to do so:
```javascript
require.config({
	baseUrl: "path_to_your/LeadsheetJS_folder/",
	paths:{
		jquery: '/my_own_absolute_path/to_my_own_jquery'
	}
});
```
The second part is the script that uses LeadsheetJS. Basically it takes a song in a specific JSON format (see json examples at [/tests/songs](/tests/songs).  And it sends it to `LeadsheetJS.init` together with the desired parameters. This is a simple example of a json song with 2 bars with chords `C | Am` and as a melody a whole rest and a whole note C/4.
```javascript
var simpleSong = {
	composer: "John ",
	title: "Whatever song",
	time: "4/4",
	changes: [{
		id: 0,
		name: "A",
		bars: [
		{
			chords: [{p: "C",
				ch: "",
				beat: 1
			}],
			melody: [{
				keys: ["B/4"],
				duration: "wr"
			}]
		},{
			chords: [{
				p: "A",
				ch: "m",
				beat: 1
			}],
			melody: [{
				keys: ["C/4"],
				duration: "W"
			}]
		}]
	}]
};
```

Important: for HTML generated by LeadsheetJS to work, the document should by specified as HTML5, so tag `<!DOCTYPE html>` goes at the top of the page.

## Get the code to work with

### Get code and dependencies

To setup the build environments, first install NodeJS and npm.

	$ git clone _this_repository_

Then, from the LeadsheetJS/ directory run:

	$ cd LeadsheetJS/
	$ npm install
	$ npm install -g grunt-cli

### Build with grunt.

	$ grunt

If you are changing some files you can use grunt watch, it will build LeadsheetJS each time a file is modified.

	$ grunt watch

To run tests in the browser, open a new tab:
 - `tests/test.html` for functionnal tests
 - `tests/viewer-test.html` for visual tests

 You can also run the tests using cli with

	$ grunt qunit

Tests use RequireJS and Qunit, like in http://www.nathandavison.com/article/17/using-qunit-and-requirejs-to-build-modular-unit-tests

There are some example also in the `samples` folder.
